# Drafty Skill Examples

Real-world examples of using the Drafty skill in Claude Code.

## Example 1: Create a Technical Blog Post

**User request:** "Write a blog post about building REST APIs in Node.js"

**Workflow:**

1. **Draft the content:**
```markdown
# Building REST APIs with Node.js and Express

REST APIs are the backbone of modern web applications. Let's build one from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Understanding of HTTP methods

## Setting Up

First, initialize your project:

\`\`\`bash
npm init -y
npm install express
\`\`\`

## Creating the Server

Create `server.js`:

\`\`\`javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ users: [] });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('API running on port 3000');
});
\`\`\`

## Testing

Use curl to test your endpoint:

\`\`\`bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

- Add authentication
- Implement database persistence
- Add input validation

Happy coding!
```

2. **Publish via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.drafty.com/api/integrations/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Drafty-API-Key: $DRAFTY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Building REST APIs with Node.js and Express",
    "content": "<content from step 1>",
    "visibility": "public",
    "tags": ["nodejs", "rest-api", "express", "tutorial"]
  }'
```

3. **Return to user:**
```

```

## Example 2: Quick Note (Private Post)

**User request:** "Save a quick note about today's standup meeting"

**Workflow:**

1. **Format as Markdown:**
```markdown

```

2. **Post as private:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.drafty.com/api/integrations/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Drafty-API-Key: $DRAFTY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{

**Workflow:**

1. **List recent posts:**
```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Drafty-API-Key: $DRAFTY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Why TypeScript Makes You a Better Developer",
    "content": "# Why TypeScript Makes You a Better Developer\n\n[Draft content...]",
    "visibility": "unlisted",
    "tags": ["typescript", "programming"]
  }'

# Post 2: Wednesday
